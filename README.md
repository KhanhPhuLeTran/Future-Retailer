# Future-Retailer
## Introduction 
The process of Future Retail's e-commerce operation, can be summarized as follows: 
* Future Retail receives products from suppliers at a "Manufacture Price." Customers purchase these products on Future Retail's online platform at a "Sale Price." Each order consists of individual items, and if a customer purchases two different items, they are split into two separate orders.
* The system records the invoice ID, customer ID, order date, product category, quantity,.... and return reason (if there is no return, this field is left blank).
* The delivery process: Shipped -> In Transit -> Delivered/Cancelled. If a customer receives an order but decides to return it for some reason (specified in the "return reason"), the order status is updated to "Cancelled."
## Project objective and strategy 
**Objective**: enhance business operations and profitability, optimize product categories based on profitability and customer preference, understand customer behavior to improve satisfaction and loyalty, evaluate sales team performance for training and motivation, and analyze order cancellations to improve service and increase customer retention.

**Strategy**: The strategy involves creating five dashboard pages to monitor five facets of Future Retail:
* Future Retail's sales activities: assessing overall profitability, efficiency of processes, and effectiveness of current strategies.
* Product Category Analysis: inform inventory management, pricing strategies, and marketing efforts, helping to maximize sales and profits.
* Customer Analysis: Gain a deeper understanding of the customer base. This information can guide marketing strategies, and product development.
* Sale agent Analysis: Assess the performance of individual salespeople. This can help in identifying training needs, adjusting sales targets, and implementing reward systems.
* Cancelled Order Analysis: Understand the reasons behind order cancellations. This can provide insights into potential issues with the product, service, or delivery process. The ultimate goal is to reduce cancellation rates
